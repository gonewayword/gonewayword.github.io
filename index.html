                          <p>
                            Hi there, I'm Brendan Frost, and you can find me in that exciting space where <span class="flair">technology and creativity blend</span> together--which is
                            nearly everywhere, these days. As a dedicated and seasoned <span class="flair">senior-level Front-End Software Engineer and Web Developer</span>, I've long had a penchant 
                            and passion for transforming complex technical challenges into easy and beautiful user experiences. Originally from Washington, D.C., 
                            I've lived in the Midwest and have now been in New Orleans, Louisiana for around 13 years.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                            My entry into the tech world was unorthodox, with a background in English and creative writing, including a stint as an English Composition 
                            Instructor at the University of New Orleans, a trainer of employees captioning phone calls for the hard-of-hearing, a retail shop manager, a lawncare worker, all of 
                            which honed my communication and leadership skills. In short, I can get along well and work effectively with anyone.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            In 2017, I leapt headlong into the world of software through the Advanced Software Engineering Immersive Program at Operation 
                            Spark, a sister program of San Francisco's Hack Reactor--and identical in coursework and level of challenge. Since then, I've 
                            grown into the Tech Nerd, Codemonger, Software Knowledge + Fiction + History Nerd that I never knew I was destined to become.
                            It has been on a ridiculously fun and challenging journey to work with innovative companies like Leviton and Zehnder Communications. My role at Leviton, 
                            I've evolved from a Website-maker and JavaScript Slinger, to a Full Stack Software Developer, to the <span class="flair">My Leviton Team Technical Lead</span>. 
                            At Leviton, I not only contributed to and led the development of impactful projects like My Leviton 3.0 but also embraced the role of 
                            a mentor and technical advisor, shaping the <span class="flair">future of the development team</span> along with the UX Design Head and Team Management Lead.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            My technical toolbelt spans a broad range of front-end and back-end technologies, with a special love for JavaScript, its 
                            frameworks like Angular and React, and web development with an emphasis on visual beauty and an obsession with user-friendliness.
                            I have thrived also in the world of IoT and smart home technology, bringing inanimate objects to 
                            life with code inside of a highly large and sophisticated codebase shaped around best practices, requiring interaction with a huge 
                            variety of other specialists, including the firmware, cloud and hardware teams. I am nerdily excited by the challenges and rewards of 
                            turning complex technical requirements into intuitive, user-friendly solutions.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            In my non-professional moments you can find me trying out smart home gadgets, building my own software projects to hack my own life, 
                            writing a historical fiction or urban-dystopic-fantasy series, reading some philosophy, tailoring thrifted clothes, cooking weird meals, 
                            or snugglging my cat Chauncey. I also love to enjoy the rich world of New Orleans with friends.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Welcome to this window into my creative and professional world--take your coat off, stay a while.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                            Oh, and don't think I forgot about the Cat Tax... here is Chauncey helping me fold my socks.
                          </p>

                            Here he is enjoying a beautiful day in the garden, back when he used to work out at the cat gym six days a week and had two tails.

                            And finally, this is him in his much, much younger days, in the late medieval era in full knight's armor.
